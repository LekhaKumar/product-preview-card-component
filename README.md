## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop



### What I learned

I am new to HTML and CSS, so I learned to build a responsive design using the Bootstrap card component through this project. I used the @media attribute in CSS to create a responsive design, where the procedure is divided into three sections. The first section is for the design of the desktop screen view. The second section is for design for the view on the mobile screen. The final section is the CSS general design compatible for desktop and mobile views.


### Continued development
I will also use this key to design other challenges and web pages. 

### Useful resources
